## Senior Project 1: Road damage detection 
### Project Overview:

A web-based solution, powered by artificial intelligence, is designed for detecting road damage, specifically potholes and cracks. The system utilizes a camera connected to the model through an API. The model begins segmentation and detects boxes whenever it identifies a pothole or crack. To mitigate model errors, any detection is filtered through a threshold. Once a problem is identified, the image of the pothole or crack, along with segmentation and box data, is stored in the database. The analysis and output are presented in a web-based interface, displaying all necessary information for authorized users.

## Senior Project 2: Magical Mirror
### Project Overview:

Data Science plays a major role in many industries, fashion is one of them. By using data science techniques, brands can have a competitive advantage over other businesses in the point that they can understand customersâ€™ shopping behavior to improve the user experience. One of the applications that might improve the customer experience is the concept of trying clothes virtually, the need for this increased more after the COVID-19 pandemic, where many people are not comfortable going back to fitting rooms again. However, most customers like to try clothes before buying them to check if they suit them. MagicalMirror will solve this issue by enabling customers to try on clothes virtually from available stock without any effort. Moreover, the system can provide recommendations based on some criteria.

## Project 3: Accident prediction
### Project Overview:

The objective of this AI model is to predict the likelihood of an accident based on the surrounding objects in a live video feed. The model has the capability to analyze the real-time footage captured by a camera and predict the possibility of an accident occurring within the next minute. Numerous factors influencing these predictions are rooted in driver behavior. The model takes into account various aspects, primarily focusing on the actions and decisions made by drivers. By assessing the interactions between the vehicle and its surroundings, the model identifies potential risk factors that could lead to an accident. This predictive analysis serves as a proactive measure to enhance safety and minimize the occurrence of accidents by providing timely warnings or alerts.

## Project 7: Arabic sentiment analysis for Amazon review
### Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to predict the aspects that customers express concerns about in reviews and categorize them as either positive or negative. Five key aspects have been extracted from the dataset, namely:
1. Services
2. Reception
3. Hotel
4. Rooms
5. Locations
To achieve this, a deep learning-based model has been developed to identify the aspects mentioned in input reviews and categorize them accordingly. Subsequently, an interactive dashboard has been created to facilitate data analysis, providing insights into the prediction outcomes.
