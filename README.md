## Senior Project 1: Road damage detection 
### Project Overview:
A web-based solution, powered by artificial intelligence, is designed for detecting road damage, specifically potholes and cracks. The system utilizes a camera connected to the model through an API. The model begins segmentation and detects boxes whenever it identifies a pothole or crack. To mitigate model errors, any detection is filtered through a threshold. Once a problem is identified, the image of the pothole or crack, along with segmentation and box data, is stored in the database. The analysis and output are presented in a web-based interface, displaying all necessary information for authorized users.

Tools:
1- Jupyter notebook
2- VSCode
3- SQL management 
4- IP camera
5- Supervisely

Python library used:
1- Tensorflow
2- PyTorch
3- openCV
4- Pillow
5- Flask

## Senior Project 2: Magical Mirror
### Project Overview:
Data Science plays a major role in many industries, fashion is one of them. By using data science
techniques, brands can have a competitive advantage over other businesses in the point that they can
understand customersâ€™ shopping behavior to improve the user experience. One of the applications that might
improve the customer experience is the concept of trying clothes virtually, the need for this increased more
after the COVID-19 pandemic, where many people are not comfortable going back to fitting rooms again.
However, most customers like to try clothes before buying them to check if they suit them. MagicalMirror
will solve this issue by enabling customers to try on clothes virtually from available stock without any
effort. Moreover, the system can provide recommendations based on some criteria.
