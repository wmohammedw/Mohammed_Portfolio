## Senior Project 1: Road damage detection 
### Project Overview:

A web-based solution, powered by artificial intelligence, is designed for detecting road damage, specifically potholes and cracks. The system utilizes a camera connected to the model through an API. The model begins segmentation and detects boxes whenever it identifies a pothole or crack. To mitigate model errors, any detection is filtered through a threshold. Once a problem is identified, the image of the pothole or crack, along with segmentation and box data, is stored in the database. The analysis and output are presented in a web-based interface, displaying all necessary information for authorized users.

## Senior Project 2: Magical Mirror
### Project Overview:

Data Science plays a major role in many industries, fashion is one of them. By using data science techniques, brands can have a competitive advantage over other businesses in the point that they can understand customersâ€™ shopping behavior to improve the user experience. One of the applications that might improve the customer experience is the concept of trying clothes virtually, the need for this increased more after the COVID-19 pandemic, where many people are not comfortable going back to fitting rooms again. However, most customers like to try clothes before buying them to check if they suit them. MagicalMirror will solve this issue by enabling customers to try on clothes virtually from available stock without any effort. Moreover, the system can provide recommendations based on some criteria.

## Project 3: Accident prediction
### Project Overview:

The objective of this AI model is to predict the likelihood of an accident based on the surrounding objects in a live video feed. The model has the capability to analyze the real-time footage captured by a camera and predict the possibility of an accident occurring within the next minute. Numerous factors influencing these predictions are rooted in driver behavior. The model takes into account various aspects, primarily focusing on the actions and decisions made by drivers. By assessing the interactions between the vehicle and its surroundings, the model identifies potential risk factors that could lead to an accident. This predictive analysis serves as a proactive measure to enhance safety and minimize the occurrence of accidents by providing timely warnings or alerts.

## Project 4: Defected fruit detection
### Project Overview:

The project involves an AI model designed to classify defective fruits. The primary objective is to determine, through image analysis, whether the fruit captured by the camera is defective or not. Upon making this classification, the system then directs the fruit to a designated path based on the prediction. The AI model leverages its training data to recognize visual cues and patterns associated with defects in fruits. Real-time processing of images from the camera enables quick and accurate identification of any flaws. The subsequent action, such as sorting the fruit based on the prediction, contributes to the overall efficiency and quality control in fruit processing or distribution systems.

## Project 5: Road tracking 
### Project Overview:

Tracking objects on the road is a crucial task, particularly in modern vehicles. The project focuses on monitoring and predicting the direction of moving objects situated in front of the car. The primary goal is to provide drivers with the ability to promptly detect any potential oncoming obstacles, enabling them to make swift decisions for enhanced safety. By implementing an optical flow algorithm, the system continuously analyzes the movement of objects within the car's vicinity. This real-time tracking capability empowers drivers with valuable information, aiding them in anticipating potential hazards and making informed decisions promptly. Ultimately, the project aims to improve overall road safety by providing drivers with a proactive tool for better situational awareness.
